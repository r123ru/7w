    "description": "The Great Wall of China is a symbol of ancient strength and perseverance.\nIt stretches over 21,000 kilometers across China’s vast northern frontier.\nConstructed over several dynasties, it was originally built to deter invasions.\nPrimarily built with stone, brick, tamped earth, and wood.\nIt began as early as the 7th century BC and was expanded during the Ming Dynasty.\nThe wall crosses deserts, mountains, grasslands, and plateaus.\nWatchtowers were used for communication and surveillance.\nSoldiers and peasants contributed to its construction for centuries.\nIt is often mistakenly thought to be a single wall — it's a network.\nPortions of the Wall are now restored and open to tourists.\nThe most famous sections are Badaling, Mutianyu, and Jinshanling.\nIt is one of the greatest architectural feats in history.\nThe Wall reflects the cultural identity of the Chinese people.\nContrary to myths, it is not visible from the Moon unaided.\nUNESCO listed it as a World Heritage Site in 1987.\nIt’s considered one of the greatest military defense projects.\nLegends surround its construction, including stories of lost lives.\nOne such tale is of a woman’s tears collapsing part of the Wall.\nIt draws over 10 million tourists annually.\nIt stands today as a powerful monument to human will.",
